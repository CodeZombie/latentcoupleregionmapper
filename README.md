# What Is It ?
Latent Couple tools for Stable Diffusion allow you to map specific prompts to specific physical regions within a canvas, allowing much finer control over the output. Unfortunately, the format in which these tools accept region bounds is one of the most unintuitive things I've ever seen. That's why I wrote this tool.

This web application allows you to create a canvas, or load in an image, then simply draw rectangular regions on it. You then write in prompts corresponding to each region.
